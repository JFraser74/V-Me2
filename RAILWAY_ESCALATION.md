# Railway GraphQL `projects` escalation (redacted)

This file is a drafted escalation payload for Railway support. It intentionally does NOT include any secrets or tokens. Do NOT commit any files that contain secrets (e.g. `railway_variables.json`).

Subject: GraphQL `projects` query failing â€” please lookup traceId(s) and advise

Summary:
- Public GraphQL endpoint: https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2
- Token: Account-level PAT used (not included here).
- `me` query: succeeds and returns account id/email (token validated).
- `projects` query: returns server-side error.

Latest failing call (do not share token):
- When: 2025-09-27 ~14:17:36 UTC
- Request body: `{"query":"query { projects { nodes { id name } } }"}`
- Response body: `{"errors":[{"message":"Problem processing request","traceId":"2730202379063267855"}]}`
- CF-RAY: 985ba01d2fe6879a-IAD

Earlier traces collected (for correlation):
- traceId 5564792971008217649 (CF-RAY 985b8c0a1fab879a-IAD)
- reqId 9434e8c0-57f7-4fd2-9007-ce42ea575313 (client-side JSON parse during PowerShell quoting)
- traceId 5381837283146782772 (earlier `me` Not Authorized during initial tests)

What I can attach (do NOT include tokens):
- `curl -v` transcripts showing request/response headers (tokens redacted client-side before attaching)
- `--trace-ascii` output showing exact request bytes
- `smoke_out` artifact (deployed smoke) if support requests it

Request to Railway Support:
Please look up backend logs for traceId `2730202379063267855` (and the other traceIds above) and advise:
- Is this a resolver exception, gateway/WAF rejection, or permission issue?
- If a permission issue, what token type/scopes are required to call `projects` from the Public API?
- Any recommended workarounds while this is investigated.

Notes for internal use:
- I will attach transcripts but will NOT paste tokens. If Railway needs the token to reproduce, I can share it via a secure channel on request.
- Local file containing tokens: `railway_variables.json` (DO NOT commit to the repo). Move to an example file or add to `.gitignore` if needed.
